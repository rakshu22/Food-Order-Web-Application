			<summary>What is YUMMY’s customer care number?</summary>
			<br>
			<div>We value our customer’s time and hence moved away from a
				single customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based support
				system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have to go
				through the maze of an IVRS call support. Just search for your issue
				in the help section on this page and initiate a chat with us. A
				customer care executive will be assigned to you shortly. You can
				also email us your issue on support@YUMMY.in Note: We value your
				privacy and your information is safe with us. Please do not reveal
				any personal information, bank account number, OTP etc. to another
				person. A YUMMY representative will never ask you for these details.
				Please do not reveal these details to fraudsters and imposters
				claiming to be calling on our behalf. Be vigilant and do not
				entertain phishing calls or emails.</div>
