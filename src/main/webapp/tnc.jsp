		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>These terms of use (the "Terms of Use") govern your use of
				our website www.YUMMY.com (the "Website") and our "YUMMY"
				application for mobile and handheld devices (the "App"). The Website
				and the App are jointly referred to as the "Platform". Please read
				these Terms of Use carefully before you use the services. If you do
				not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use the services on the
				Platform, and we request you to uninstall the App. By installing,
				downloading or even merely using the Platform, you shall be
				contracting with YUMMY and you signify your acceptance to this Terms
				of Use and other YUMMY policies (including but not limited to the
				Cancellation & Refund Policy, Privacy Policy and Take Down Policy)
				as posted on the Platform and amended from time to time, which takes
				effect on the date on which you download, install or use the
				Platform, and create a legally binding arrangement to abide by the
				same.</li>
			</br>
			<li>The Platform is owned and operated by Bundl Technologies
				Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the
				Companies Act, 1956 and having its registered office at No.55, Sy
				No.8-14, Ground Floor, I&J Block, Embassy Tech Village, Outer Ring
				Road, Devarbisanahalli, Bengaluru – 560103, Karnataka, India. For
				the purpose of these Terms of Use, wherever the context so requires,
				"you", “user”, or “User” shall mean any natural or legal person who
				shall transaction on the Platform by providing registration data
				while registering on the Platform as a registered user using any
				computer systems. The terms "YUMMY", "we", "us" or "our" shall mean
				Bundl Technologies Private Limited.</li>
			</br>
			<li>YUMMY enables transactions on its Platform between
				participating restaurants/merchants and buyers, dealing in (a)
				prepared food and beverages, (b) consumer goods, and (c) other
				products and services ("Platform Services"). The buyers ("Buyer/s")
				can choose and place orders ("Orders") from a variety of products
				and services listed and offered for sale by various merchants
				including but not limited to the restaurants, eateries and grocery
				stores ("Merchant/s"), on the Platform. Further, the Buyer can also
				place Orders for undertaking certain tasks on the Platform
				(“Tasks”).</li>
			</br>
			<li>YUMMY enables delivery of such Orders or completion of Tasks
				at select localities of serviceable cities across India ("Delivery
				Services") by connecting third party service providers i.e. pick-up
				and delivery partners (“PDP”) who will be responsible for providing
				the pick-up and delivery services and completing Tasks initiated by
				the users of the Platform (Buyers or Merchants). The Platform
				Services and Delivery Services are collectively referred to as
				"Services". For both Platform Services and Delivery Services, YUMMY
				is merely acting as an intermediary between the Merchants and Buyers
				and/or PDPs and Buyers/Merchants.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>PDPs are individual entrepreneurs engaged with YUMMY on a
			voluntary, non-exclusive and principal to principal basis to provide
			aforementioned services for service fee. PDPs are independent
			contractors and are free to determine their timings of work. YUMMY
			does not exercise control on the PDPs and the relationship between
			the PDPs and YUMMY is not that of an agent and principal or employee
			and employer.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For the pickup and delivery services and completing the
				Tasks, PDPs may charge the users of the Platform (Buyers or
				Merchants), a service fee (inclusive of applicable taxes whenever
				not expressly mentioned) determined on the basis of various factors
				including but not limited to distance covered, time taken, demand
				for delivery services/Tasks, real time analysis of traffic and
				weather conditions, seasonal peaks or such other parameters as may
				be determined from time to time.</li>
			</br>
			<li>Amendments These Terms of Use are subject to modifications.
				We reserve the right to modify or change these Terms of Use and
				other YUMMY policies at any time by posting modified documents on
				the Platform and notifying you of the same for your perusal. You
				shall be liable to update yourself of such changes, if any, by
				accessing the same. You shall, at all times, be responsible for
				regularly reviewing the Terms of Use and the other YUMMY policies
				and note the changes made on the Platform. Your continued usage of
				the Services after any change is posted constitutes your acceptance
				of the amended Terms of Use and other YUMMY policies. As long as you
				comply with these Terms of Use, YUMMY grants you a personal,
				non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited privilege to access, enter,
				and use the Platform. By accepting these Terms of Use, you also
				accept and agree to be bound by the other terms and conditions and
				YUMMY policies (including but not limited to Cancellation & Refund
				Policy, Privacy Policy and Notice and Take Down Policy) as may be
				posted on the Platform from time to time.</li>
